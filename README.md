# compress-test

This project's aim was to implement common compression methods in a high level language. This was done to gain more insight on how to write in clojure, and on how compression algorithms work.

This project is just a demonstration. Performance is terrible, so it is not meant to be used as a real program. I also meant to compare performance between Huffman and arithmetic encoding, however, as of writing this, only Huffman coding was implemented.

# Usage

The code is not in a fully polished and working state. However, it can be used by editing the main `.clj` file. The input text which gets compressed can be written in `input.txt` in the main directory.
